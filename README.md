# login-system
<p>Making a login system to practice with SQL and Python</q>
I plan on using sqlite3 Py module and 'Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 minutes' to create a login system that can store some data.

note to self:
 - 03:30 Code opimization looks kinda poopy, go fix that later
	 Like use more forloop
